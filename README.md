## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Guide: Setting Up LightUp with Plasmo Framework

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js 16.x or later installed.
2. **Package Manager**: It's recommended to use `pnpm`, but `npm` or `yarn` will also work.

### Steps to Download and Start Development

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mohamedsadiq/LightUp.git
     cd LightUp
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install all necessary packages:
     ```bash
     pnpm install
     ```
   - If you're using `npm` or `yarn`, replace `pnpm` with your package manager of choice.

3. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Start the development server with live-reloading:
     ```bash
     pnpm dev
     ```
   - This will watch for file changes and automatically reload your extension in the browser.

4. **Load the Extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
   - Click "Load Unpacked" and select the `build/chrome-mv3-dev` directory.

5. **Start Developing**
   - You can now start modifying the source code located in the `src` directory.
   - Use the Plasmo Framework's features to enhance the extension as needed.

### Additional Resources

- **Plasmo Framework Documentation**: [Plasmo Docs](https://docs.plasmo.com/)
- **React + TypeScript**: Ensure familiarity with these technologies as they are used extensively in the project.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for animations within the extension.
